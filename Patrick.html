        <H1>How Finnacial fraud has been prevented by using AI (artificial intelligence) and ML (machine learning)</H1>
            
        <H2>How fraudsters have been using AI to defraud finnacial services</H2>
        <p>Fraudsers have been using AI to absorb personal information such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emails</li>
            <li>Photos</li>
            <li>Videos</li>
            <li>Voice Recordings</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This has has been used to impersonate human beings to then use social engineering to gain access to private information that can then be used to acces their online banking</p>
          
        <h2> How has Machine learning been used by finnacial services to prevent fraud?</h2>
        <p>Banks have been using machine learning to analyse large amounts of historical and real-time transaction to flag anomalies as potential fraud</p>
        <h3>What happens when a potential annomoly is detected?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes a false positive is detected and the user can bypass it being using additional forms of verification to confirm that it isn't fraud.</p>
        <p>However when it is fraud security systems such as 2 factor authentication can prevent the fraud.</p>
        <p>2FA ensures that the person accessing the bank account is not a intruding third party. 2FA utilises a second form of verification to confirm the identity these include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>SMS based: by sending a one time password to their phone number.</li>
            <li>Authenticator apps: Apps on the users phone that also provide a one time password.</li>
            <li>Email based: OTP to their email.</li>
            <li>Biometric authentication: Fingerprint, Facial recognition, Voice recognition.</li>
            <li>Secuity question: A response to a pre-set question that the user already knows.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>2FA makes these accounts a lot more secure but with the prevelance of AI being used to social engineer malicosu partys have been able to gain access to two of these forms of authenticaiton leading to the 2FA being breached.</p>
        

        <H2>Preventing money laudering and complying with AML with Machine Learing</H2>
        <P> With machine learing, finncaila instituation can more effectivly comply with anti money laudering laws to detect money laundering activities and reporting suspicous activities.</P>
        <p> Additionally AI has been used to streamline the KYC (know your customer) process to verify customers identities.</p>
        <H2> Conclusion</H2>
        <p>The use of AI and Machine learining has massivley improved the security of finnacial institues and has made them more effective at preveneting finnacial crimes.</p>
