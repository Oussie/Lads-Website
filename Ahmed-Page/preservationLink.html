        <h1>The importance of hardware preservation</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Over the years, older hardware has continued to degrade over time, causing older systems to be lost to the past. These older systems pose as a landmark for human innovation, and many would agree that they should be preserved for years to come, however, due to companies refusing the production of the materials required to create these systems, it has been very difficult to preserve them.</p>

        <h1>Using emulation to preserve hardware</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Through the use of emulation, we can still preserve the technology by immitating the hardware functionality of the original hardware. The way in which emulation works, is that it abstracts the hardwares functionality down to the machine level, and replicates all of its logic flow, such as the devices addressing modes, instructions, registers etc. By using emulation, we can garuntee that devices produced decades ago can still be revisited.</p>

        <h1>Other Notes</h1>
    </div>
    <p1>As a byproduct, developers also create bluprints for how the original hardware operated, breaking down how the machine operated such that it could be reconstructed for future use. A great example of this is the NESDev reference guide, which breaks down key elements such as CPU processing, graphical processing, input devices etc. See <a href="https://www.nesdev.org/wiki/NES_reference_guide#Hardware_reference">here</a> for more details.</p1>
