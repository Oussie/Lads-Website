    <h1>Scientists Utilise Deep Learning With Satellites To Count Elephants From Outer Space!</h1>
    <p>By Yonal Ariyananda</p>
    
    <p>People love to talk about the phenomenon that is space.</p>
    <p>Not just space, but what you can see from it.</p>
    <p>We all know that we can see massive landmarks from space, such as the pyramids or the Great wall of China.</p>
    <p>But what if we could see far smaller objects or beings? Something like Elephants.</p>
    <p>Luckily for us, a team of researchers may have found way for this to happen, and consequently ensuring the welfare and survival of many wildlife species going forwards.</p>

    <div class="importance">
        <h2><strong>Why is it important to count elephants?</strong></h2>
        <p>The population of African elpehants has plummeted over the last century due to various reasons such as poaching,retaliatory killing for crop raiding and habitat fragmentation.</p>
        <p>Protection of these elephants depends heavily on know exactly where they are and how many exist- accurate monitering is extremely vital.</p>
        <p>The existing methods however, are prone to error.</p>
        <p>And inaccurate counts leads to misallocation of scarce conservation resources and misunderstanding population trends.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Profiles">
        <h2><strong>Who are these researchers?</strong></h2>
        <p>The researchers responsible for this breakthrough comes from the Wildlife Conservation Research Unit, University of Oxford,</p>
        <p>And the Machine Learning Department, University of Bath.</p>

    <div class="What they've done">
        <h2><strong>What have they done that's so impressive?</strong></h2>
        <p>For the first time <strong>ever</strong>, scientists have been able to utilise satellite cameras coupled with deep learning to count animals in complex geographical landscapes.</p>
        <p>They have done so by using imagery from Maxar satellites, which opens a whole new way to moniter vulnerable and endangered animals.</p>

    <div class="How have we been surveying elephant populations uptil now?">
        <h2><strong>How have we been surveying elephant populations uptil now?</strong></h2>
        <p>Right now the most common survey technique for elephant populations in savannah environments are aerial counts from manned aircraft.</p>
        <p>However, this presents a myriad of problems such as follows:</p>
                  <li class="list-group-item">Observers on aerial surveys can get exhausted, be hindered by poor visibility and otherwise succumb to bias.</li>
                  <li class="list-group-item">Aerial surveys can also be costly and logistically challenging.</li>
    </div>


    <div class="Advantages">
        <h2><strong>Advantages of this method when compared to human detection.</strong></h2>
                        <li class="list-group-item">Eliminates the risk of Double counting.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item ">Allows for repeat surveys at short intervals.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item ">Requires no ground prescence hence no animals are disturbed.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item ">Previously inaccesible areas become accessible</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item ">Cross-border areas can be surveyed without the time-consuming need of obtaining terrestrial permits.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item ">The Deep learning system is able to process enormous amounts of data in a matter of hours(humans would have taken months).</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item ">The results from Deep Learning are also more consistent, less prone to error, false negatives and false positives.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item ">This system can also be rectifies by continously improving models- which cannot be said for humans.</li>
