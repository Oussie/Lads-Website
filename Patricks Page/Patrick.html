                <H2>How Fraudsters have been using AI to defraud financial services</H2>
                <p>Fraudsers have been using AI to absorb personal information such as:</p>
                <div class="col-lg-2">
                    <ul class="list-group" style="width: 50">
                        <li class="list-group-item list-group-item-danger">Emails</li>

                    </ul>
                </div>
                  <p>This has been used to impersonate human beings to then use social engineering to gain access to private information that can then be used to access their online banking</p>

             <!-- Card for Machine learning -->
            <div class="card-body"style="padding: 20px;">

                <H2>How has Machine learning been used by financial services to prevent fraud?</H2>
                <p>Banks have been using machine learning to analyse large amounts of historical and real-time transaction to flag anomaly as potential fraud</p>
                <h3>What happens when a potential annomoly is detected?</h3>
                <p>Sometimes a false positive is detected and the user can bypass it being using additional forms of verification to confirm that it isn't fraud.</p>
                <p>However when it is fraud security systems such as 2 factor authentication can prevent the fraud.</p>
                <p>2FA ensures that the person accessing the bank account is not a intruding third party. 2FA utilises a second form of verification to confirm the identity these include:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>SMS based: by sending a one time password to their phone number.</li>
                    <li>Authenticator apps: Apps on the users phone that also provide a one time password.</li>
                    <li>Email based: OTP to their email.</li>
                    <li>Biometric authentication: Fingerprint, Facial recognition, Voice recognition.</li>
                    <li>Secuity question: A response to a pre-set question that the user already knows.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>While 2FA makes accounts significantly more secure, the growing use of AI for social engineering by malicious parties has allowed some to bypass security by compromising two forms of authentication, leading to breaches in 2FA.</p>

        <H2>Preventing money laundering and complying with AML with Machine Learing</H2>
        <P> With machine learing, financial institutions can more effectively comply with anti money laudering laws to detect money laundering activities and reporting suspicious activities.</P>
        <p> Additionally AI has been used to streamline the KYC (know your customer) process to verify customers identities.</p>
        <H2> Conclusion</H2>
        <p>The use of AI and Machine learning has massivley improved the security of financial institutes and has made them more effective at preventing financial crimes.</p>
